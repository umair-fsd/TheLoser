          <p>In addition, some of our applications and mobile-optimized sites may have location-based features. To deliver these features, we may collect and use location data provided by your mobile device. For example, we may offer shopping features that allow you to get information about local merchants. By using such applications, you consent to the collection and use of your mobile device location data for purposes of delivering these location-based features.</p>
          <p>We may use personal information collected from any of the sources listed in the &ldquo;How Does THE LOSER Collect Personal Information?&rdquo; section of this policy for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing new products, enhancing our websites and apps, improving our THE LOSER Services, identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns.</p>
          <p>We may aggregate and/or de-identify data about customers and site visitors and use it for any purpose, including product and service development and improvement activities.</p>
          <p>DOES THE LOSER SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</p>
          <p>We do not sell your personal information. However, we share personal information with our vendors, contractors, business and service partners, or other third parties (collectively, &ldquo;Service Providers&rdquo;). Examples of Service Providers include analysis firms, advertisers, payment processing companies, customer service and support providers, email, IT services and SMS vendors, web hosting and development companies and fulfillment companies. Service Providers also include our co-promotion partners for products that we jointly develop and/or market with other companies.</p>
          <p>Some Service Providers may collect personal data on behalf of THE LOSER. These third parties may be provided with access to personal data needed to perform their functions. In addition, THE LOSER&rsquo;s practice is to require its Service Providers to keep your personal information confidential and to use personal information only to perform functions for THE LOSER.</p>
          <p>If THE LOSER sells all or part of one of its product lines or divisions, your information may be transferred to the buyer. THE LOSER reserves the right to disclose your information to respond to authorized information requests from government authorities, to respond to valid judicial requests, to address national security situations, to provide security and investigate potential fraud, or when otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
          <p>THE LOSER may also disclose your personal information as required by law to any competent law enforcement body, regulatory or government agency, court or other third party where we believe the disclosure is necessary or appropriate to comply with a regulatory requirement, judicial proceeding, court order, government request or legal process served on us, or to protect the safety, rights, or property of our customers, the public, THE LOSER or others, and to exercise, establish or defend THE LOSER&rsquo;s legal rights.</p>
          <p>THE LOSER may also disclose aggregate or de-identified data that is not personally identifiable to third parties for any purpose.</p>
          <p>COOKIES AND OTHER TOOLS</p>
          <p>THE LOSER and its Service Providers collect information about you by using cookies, tracking pixels, web beacons and other technologies (collectively, &ldquo;Tools&rdquo;). We use this information to better understand, customize and improve user experience with our websites, services and offerings as well as to manage our advertising. This information can make your use of our THE LOSER Services easier and more meaningful by allowing THE LOSER and our Service Providers to provide better service, customize sites based on consumer preferences, compile statistics, provide you with more relevant advertisements based on your interests, analyze trends and otherwise administer and improve our THE LOSER Services. If we have collected your personal information, we may associate this personal data with information gathered through the Tools.</p>
          <p>Your web browser can be set to allow you to control whether you will accept cookies, reject cookies, or to notify you each time a cookie is sent to your browser. If your browser is set to reject cookies, websites that are cookie-enabled will not recognize you when you return to the website, and some website functionality may be lost. The Help section of your browser may tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies. To find out more about cookies, visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/">www.aboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
          <p>You can also control Flash cookies which we may use on certain THE LOSER websites and apps from time to time by clicking&nbsp;<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">here</a>. Why? Because Flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings. Choices you make are both browser and device-specific.</p>
          <p>Here are some of the types of information collected when visiting THE LOSER Websites:</p>
          <p><strong><em>Log data:</em></strong>&nbsp;When you use THE LOSER websites and apps, our servers automatically record information (&ldquo;log data&rdquo;), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit an website or app or your mobile app sends when you are using it. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the webpages you visited that had THE LOSER features, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, how you used websites and cookie data.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Cookie data:</em></strong>&nbsp;Depending on how you are accessing THE LOSER&rsquo;s online Services, we and our Service Providers may use &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our sites, unique to your THE LOSER account or your browser) or similar technologies, to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use &ldquo;session&rdquo; cookies (that last until you close your browser) or &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; cookies (that last until you and/or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to remember your personal preferences, such as sections of the website that you visit frequently, your user ID, or other settings so you do not have to set them up every time you visit, and we may use cookies to serve you relevant advertising tailored to your interests. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your THE LOSER account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us), and other cookies are not.</p>
          <p>We may use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the LOSER Services and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources. You can learn about Google&rsquo;s practices by going to&nbsp;<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/google-partners">https://policies.google.com/privacy/google-partners</a>, and opt-out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Social media plugins and data.</em></strong>&nbsp;In addition, our websites and apps may use social media plugins (e.g., the Facebook "Like" button, '"Share to Twitter"' button) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit any of our online THE LOSER Services, the operator of the social plugin can place a cookie on your computer, enabling that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our websites. If you are logged into the social media website (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Google+) while browsing on our THE LOSER Services, the social plugins allow that social media website to receive information that you have visited our THE LOSER Services. The social plugins also allow the social media website to share information about your activities on THE LOSER with other users of their social media website. THE LOSER does not control any of the content from the social plugins. For more information about social plugins from other social media websites you should refer to those sites' privacy and data sharing statements.</p>
          <p>If you choose to link your social media or Google account to THE LOSER, this allows us to obtain information from those accounts (such as your friends or contacts). The information we obtain from these services often depends on your settings or the applicable provider's privacy policies, so please check these policies before granting us access. You agree that we are not responsible for any acts or omissions by these social media service providers. If you give us permission to access this information, we will use it for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Device information.</em></strong>&nbsp;In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you are using to access our THE LOSER Services, including what type of device it is, what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you are using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you are using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device may make available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Interest Based Advertising.</em></strong>&nbsp;THE LOSER hopes to deliver to you advertising for products and services you need or want. THE LOSER, its vendors and partners, use common tracking tools, such as cookies, pixels, web beacons, and similar technologies, to automatically collect information about users for purposes of enhancing their online experience and delivering more meaningful advertisements. Like many companies, THE LOSER may also utilize third-party advertising vendors and other partners to collect this information.</p>
          <p>Like most companies, we place advertisements where we think they will be most relevant to customers. One way we do so is by allowing network advertising companies with whom we work to place their own Tools when an individual visits THE LOSER websites and apps. This enables the network advertising company to recognize individuals who have previously visited THE LOSER websites and apps and to serve you ads based on your web browsing activity, purchases, interests and/or other information&mdash;a practice commonly referred to as interest-based advertising (&ldquo;IBA&rdquo;) or online behavioral advertising (&ldquo;OBA&rdquo;).</p>
          <p>These advertising companies may also use these types of technologies to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile phone or a laptop, and serve you ads on websites you visit and applications you use.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Retargeting.</em></strong>&nbsp;One way in which we deliver more meaningful advertisements is through a common form of online advertising known as &ldquo;retargeting&rdquo; or &ldquo;remarketing.&rdquo; Retargeting works by serving ads on one site based on an individual&rsquo;s online activities on a different, unrelated site. For example, if you look at Fashion products on THE LOSER website, you may later see an advertisement for Fashion when you visit third-party sites. To do this, THE LOSER or its advertising vendors may use a device ID, cookie, pixel, web beacon or similar technology placed by THE LOSER or our third-party vendor when you visit THE LOSER websites or apps or third-party websites or apps. The placing of these cookies or other technologies on your device may enable you to be identified across multiple websites. You should consult the privacy policies of our vendors and other websites that you visit to understand how they collect and use your data.</p>
          <p>WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE ABOUT HOW THE LOSER COLLECTS AND USES INFORMATION ABOUT ME?</p>
          <p>Certain THE LOSER Services may ask whether you wish to opt-out or opt into our contact lists for offers, promotions and additional services that may be of interest to you.</p>
          <p>MARKETING AND OTHER COMMUNICATION</p>
          <p>You may receive notifications and emails from us on the contact address/es registered with us. If you no longer wish to receive such materials from us on a going-forward basis, you may opt-out of receiving such materials. You may unsubscribe by following the instructions included in the notification or email. We will endeavor to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
          <p>However, even if you opt out of receiving such communications, we retain the right to send you non-marketing communications (such as security alerts, administrative messages and information about changes to our Privacy Policy or Terms of Use).</p>
          <p>YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES</p>
          <p>You may have certain rights and choices regarding our processing of your personal data. Depending on your jurisdiction, applicable law may entitle you to additional consumer rights, including the right (with certain limitations and exceptions) to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Know the categories and/or specific pieces of personal information collected about you, including whether your personal information is sold or disclosed, and with whom your personal information was shared</li>
            <li>Access a copy of the personal information we retain about you</li>
            <li>Request deletion of your personal information</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We reserve the right to verify your identity in connection with any requests regarding personal information to help ensure that we provide the information we maintain to the individuals to whom it pertains, and allow only those individuals or their authorized representatives to exercise rights with respect to that information. If you are an authorized agent making a request on behalf of a consumer, we may require and request additional information to verify that you are authorized to make that request.</p>
          <p>We reserve the right to deny your request if we cannot verify your identify. Where we deny your request in whole or in part, we will endeavor to inform you of the denial and provide an explanation of our actions and the reasons for the denial.</p>
          <p>We will not restrict or deny you access to our THE LOSER Services because of choices and requests you make in connection with your personal information. Please note, certain choices may affect our ability to deliver the THE LOSER Services. For example, if you sign up to receive marketing communications by email, then ask THE LOSER to delete all of your information, we will be unable to send you marketing communications.</p>
          <p>You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal information by contacting us using the details provided under the &ldquo;How can I contact the Loser &ldquo;section below.</p>
          <p>HOW DOES THE LOSER SECURE INFORMATION?</p>

THE LOSER cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not gain access to your information; therefore, when submitting personal information to THE LOSER websites or apps, you must weigh both the benefits and the risks. THE LOSER websites or apps may link to third-party websites that are not controlled by THE LOSER or subject to an THE LOSER privacy policy. You should check the privacy policies of such third-party websites before submitting personal information.</p>
          <p>This Website is Not for Children<br /> THE LOSER does not knowingly collect or use any information from children (we define &ldquo;children&rdquo; as minors younger than 18). We do not knowingly allow children to order our products, communicate with us, or use any of our online services. If you are a parent and become aware that your child has provided us with information, please contact us using one of the methods specified below and we will work with you to address this issue.</p>
          <p>Third party sites<br /> We may provide links to websites and other third-party content that is not owned or operated by THE LOSER. The websites and third-party content to which we link may have separate privacy notices or policies. THE LOSER is not responsible for the privacy practices of any entity that it does not own or control.</p>
          <p>If you provide any personal through a third-party site, your interaction and your personal information will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of, that third party site. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of any such third parties, which are not governed by this privacy policy.</p>
          <p><strong>Cross border transfers</strong></p>
          <p><br /> Any information you provide to THE LOSER may be stored and processed, transferred between and accessed from the United States, where THE LOSER is headquartered, and other countries which may not guarantee the same level of protection of personal data as the one in which you reside. However, THE LOSER will handle your personal data in accordance with this privacy policy regardless of where your personal data is stored/accessed.</p>
